        INTRODUCTION
        Urban League of Eastern Mass Presents MSIMBO. Here we are dedicated to closing the gap in technology where few
        African Americans or Latinos can be found in a billion-dollar industry in these modern times. In choosing our
        name we wanted to connect to our roots. MSIMBO means Code in Swahili. Our coding Bootcamp is intense but the
        skills and connections you make will last a lifetime. Also you can play an important part in helping this
        country evolve in a historical way. In many cases you will be opening doors for others to join an industry that
        often over-look people from low-income Neighborhoods'. The Training consist of 20 wks. Whether you have previous
        knowledge of coding or web design. If you can download anything from the internet, you can learn how to code for
        program software creation Design websites collaborate with others for bigger companies. see alumni page
